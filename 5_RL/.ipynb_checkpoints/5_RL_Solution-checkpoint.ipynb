    "# Lab 5: Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://www.kdnuggets.com/images/reinforcement-learning-fig1-700.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to teach agents to act in the real, physical world, games provide a convenient proving ground for developing RL algorithms and agents. Games have some properties that make them particularly well suited for RL: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.   In many cases, games have perfectly describable environments. For example, all rules of chess can be formally written and programmed into a chess game simulator;\n",
    "2.   Games are massively parallelizable. Since they do not require running in the real world, simultaneous environments can be run on large data clusters; \n",
    "3.   Simpler scenarios in games enable fast prototyping. This speeds up the development of algorithms that could eventually run in the real-world; and\n",
    "4.   ... Games are fun! \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous labs, we have explored both supervised (with LSTMs, CNNs) and unsupervised / semi-supervised (with VAEs) learning tasks. Reinforcement learning is fundamentally different, in that we are training a deep learning algorithm to govern the actions of our RL agent, that is trying, within its environment, to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. The goal of training an RL agent is to determine the best next step to take to earn the greatest final payoff or return. In this lab, we focus on building a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity. \n",

    "In order to model the environment for both the Cartpole and Pong tasks, we'll be using a toolkit developed by OpenAI called [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). It provides several pre-defined environments for training and testing reinforcement learning agents, including those for classic physics control tasks, Atari video games, and robotic simulations. To access the Cartpole environment, we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`, which we gained access to when we imported the `gym` package. We can instantiate different [environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control) by passing the enivronment name to the `make` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue we might experience when developing RL algorithms is that many aspects of the learning process are inherently random: initializing game states, changes in the environment, and the agent's actions. As such, it can be helpful to set a initial \"seed\" for the environment to ensure some level of reproducibility. Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time."

    "Having had no prior knowledge of the environment, the agent will begin to learn how to balance the pole on the cart based only on the feedback received from the environment! Having defined how our agent can move, how it takes in new observations, and how it updates its state, we'll see how it gradually learns a policy of actions to optimize balancing the pole as long as possible. To do this, we'll track how the rewards evolve as a function of training -- how should the rewards change as training progresses?"

Well that's exactly the case in [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), since part of the environment is the opposing player. We don't know how our opponent will act or react to our actions, so the complexity of our problem increases. It also becomes much more interesting, since we can compete to beat our opponent. RL provides a powerful framework for training AI systems with the ability to handle and interact with dynamic, unpredictable environments.
